<p>Amidst the beginning of a new age dominated by digital devices and applications, one cannot overlook the importance of mobile network technology. Mobile is a necessary part of both enterprises' and consumers' daily lives, providing access to tablets, watches, laptops, iPods, netbooks, and many other connected devices.</p>
<p>With approximately&nbsp;<a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/mobile-internet-traffic" target="_blank">4.32 billion</a>&nbsp;active mobile Internet users, and&nbsp;<a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/mobile-internet-traffic" target="_blank">58.43 percent</a>&nbsp;of website traffic coming from mobile devices, the time is ripe for enterprises around the world to begin emphasizing the security of their mobile network.</p>
<p>Mobile networks are enticing targets for would-be cyber attackers because they are susceptible to browser-based and web-borne attacks. Browser-based and web-borne attacks are tricky for individual subscribers and organizations to defend against, as they exploit vulnerabilities, such as outdated browsers, plug-ins, and other components, injecting malicious code into website components. These types of attacks can be devastating, costing organizations, on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.morphisec.com/hubfs/1111/briefs/BrowserAttacksBrief-190327.pdf" target="_blank">average, $3.2M per breach</a>. What makes these attacks even more terrifying is how common they are, as <u>85 percent&nbsp;</u><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/light-point/white-papers/wp-most-serious-threat-to-business.pdf" target="_blank">of all current malware</a>&nbsp;is spread via web browsers.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian mobile operator community has taken many impactful steps to defend its mobile networks and ensure their resilience. One such action taken has been to adopt and leverage some of the cyber security solutions that are becoming available with every passing day, which can help provide the most up-to-date cyber security protocols.</p>
<p>DefensX, a developer of zero-trust cybersecurity applications, recently announced it has partnered with lifecell, a Ukrainian telecom operator and a subsidiary of Turkcell&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.tmcnet.com/snapshots/snapshots.aspx?Company=Turkcell" target="_blank">News</a>-<a href="https://www.tmcnet.com/enews/subs.aspx?k1=%22Turkcell%22">Alert</a>), to provide mobile communication and data transfer services based on high-speed Internet to provide next-level protection against growing, web-borne cyber attacks.</p>
<p>"We are proud to bring an array of solutions to lifecell as digital attacks continue to rise in war-torn Ukraine," said Halis Osman Erkan, founder and CEO of DefensX, which is a platform designed for service providers, enabling effective, easy-to-install, and manage, and cost-effective browser-based, pure cloud cyber protection at a fraction of the price of legacy solutions. "Given our complementary architectures and shared vision for cloud and Internet-based communications applications, DefensX and lifecell are a perfect fit, especially as cloud telco digital transformation accelerates."</p>
<p>Eighty percent of cyber-attacks involve web browsers, and DefensX Secure Web Browser protects individuals and organizations from being infected by malware on malicious websites, phishing attacks designed to steal credentials, and increasingly sophisticated Adware. Adware is a form of malware that displays unwanted advertisements on smartphones and computers, commonly activated unknowingly when users are trying to install legitimate applications that the Adware is bundled with.</p>
<p>The DefensX Secure Web Browser made by lifecell is available to all its subscribers who seek privacy and protection of their personal data online. DefensX can be activated in minutes on one to five devices using a USSD code or SMS.</p>
<p>Subscribers simply start using the DefensX browser, which identifies malicious websites and blocks them to protect individuals and businesses from various types of web threats.</p>
<p>Specific features include:</p>
<p><strong>Zero Trust Web Protection</strong></p>
<p>There are many risky websites on the Internet, and subscribers may find themselves visiting one of the malicious websites without knowing what is waiting for them there. DefensX identifies malicious websites and blocks accessing these sites to protect users from various types of web threats.</p>
<p><strong>Zero Trust Credentials Protection</strong></p>
<p>Phishing attacks pretending to be legitimate websites trick end-users into entering their usernames/passwords to steal valuable, personal, and sensitive data. DefensX uses Artificial Intelligence to identify phishing web pages and prevents users from entering their passwords, stopping cybercriminals in their tracks.</p>
<p><strong>Adware Protection</strong></p>
<p>DefensX detects potential ADware attack surfaces within web pages and removes those risk elements in the web pages. DefensX not only protects end-users and businesses from harmful ADware but does so without slowing down or otherwise preventing a smooth user experience.</p>
<p>"DefensX also brings lifecell an immediate solution addressing the alarming growth of zero-day attacks, so much so that we refer to our solution as zero-hour," Erkan said. "Our phishing protection/credential protection feature has AI capabilities that can detect computer-software vulnerabilities previously unknown to those needing real-time mediation, including providers of the target software. Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers, or a network, leading to potentially severely damaging devices, networks, and applications."</p>
<p>lifecell provides mobile communication and data transfer services based on high-speed Internet in Ukraine. The company has developed an innovative ecosystem across the telecommunications industry, implementing Smart City and Smart Region projects, improving citizens' security, and developing IoT networks. &nbsp;As of the end of Q4 2022, lifecell 3-month active subscriber base was 8.5 million users.</p>
<p>Lifecell is owned by Turkcell, Turkey's largest provider of converged telecom and technology services. Turkcell is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Borsa Istanbul (BIST). More information about lifecell can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lifecell.ua/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://info.saasalerts.com/sasi-report-2023" target="_blank">SaaS Alerts</a>, 2022 saw a 61% increase in the rate of phishing attacks, a number all industry analysts expect to grow even further this year.</p>
<p><br>Equally troubling, the report found a 29% increase in the number of guest user accounts, which can have access to sensitive data and open access points for bad actors. Of the over 979,840 SaaS&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.tmcnet.com/snapshots/snapshots.aspx?Company=SaaS" target="_blank">News</a>-<a href="https://www.tmcnet.com/enews/subs.aspx?k1=%22SaaS%22&amp;k2=+%22software+as+a+service%22">Alert</a>) accounts monitored by SaaS Alerts in 2022, 54% were from guest user accounts versus licensed users.</p>
<p>Adware alone&nbsp;<a href="https://dataprot.net/statistics/malware-statistics/" target="_blank">accounts for 48% of all malware</a>. When Adware reaches smartphones, without proper protection, it can unlock access to a single end-user while potentially providing easy access to corporate information and systems.</p>
