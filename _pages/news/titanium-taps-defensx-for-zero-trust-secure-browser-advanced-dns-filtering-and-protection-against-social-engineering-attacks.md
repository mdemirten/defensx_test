<p>Fair Lawn, NJ; New York, New York, USA; June 6, 2023 –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.defensx.com/" target="_self">DefensX</a>™, developer of a Zero-Trust Secure Web Browser extension and cyber security solutions, today announced they have been selected by Titanium, a premier provider of professional and managed information technology services, telecommunications, and&nbsp;asset leasing services, to provide a range of cybersecurity solutions designed to protect individuals and organizations from the fastest growing threats today.</p>
<p>Founded in 2008, by Chad Chamides, Titanium started as Titanium Communications, a firm offering customized and affordable phone systems and carrier services. Working with multiple IT firms throughout the years, Chad realized that the professional world needed more than what was out there – better quality, better service, and a better attention to detail.&nbsp;This led to Titanium in its present form – serving and providing all aspects of technology to those in need by an elite staff that truly cares about the end result.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, the company serves customers in New York and Connecticut, in states across America, and in other countries and regions including France, Latin America, Japan, Sweden and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Titanium is now offering the full range of DefensX offerings, including their Zero-Trust Secure Web Browser extension, with AD-Ware Protection, Zero-Trust Web Protection, Zero-Trust Credentials, Zero-Trust File Protection, Remote Browser Isolation, DNS++, and a cloud-first architecture that has been adopted by major distribution channels around the world.</p>
<p>"DefensX has been a great addition to our offering,” said Jason Romer, Chief Operating Officer at Titanium. “As a zero-trust web, credentials, and DNS protection solution, it has provided us with unparalleled security and peace of mind. The ability to categorize websites and enforce granular access policies has been invaluable, enabling us to tailor the browsing experience to our clients' specific needs. Moreover, the DefensX team has been exceptional, always responsive, and knowledgeable, ensuring our questions and concerns are addressed promptly. We highly recommend DefensX to any MSP looking for a comprehensive and reliable security solution.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are very proud to work with the finest managed service providers like Titanium, a great partner who understands the urgency of addressing modern threats in more efficient ways,” said founder and CEO of DefensX, Osman Erkan. “With our proven global platform, Titanium can instantly deliver comprehensive protection to their large customer base across industries including manufacturing, automotive, retail, healthcare, and assisted living facilities, as well as general offices. Titanium’s dedication to its customers and focus on ensuring those customers are protected from existing and emerging threats, along with their world-class team of experts and support professionals has driven their growth and burnished their reputation.
