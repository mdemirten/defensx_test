<p>Leading Communications and Technology Event Returns to Florida for 22<sup>nd</sup> Consecutive Year</p>
<p>Shelton, CT – May 31, 2021 – TMC today announced that DefensX will be exhibiting their next generation cybersecurity solutions designed to eradicate risk from web-borne threats at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mspexpo.com/east/">MSP Expo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.futureofworkexpo.com/">Future of Work Expo</a>&nbsp;part of the #TECHSUPERSHOW, being held June 21-24, 2022 at the Greater Fort Lauderdale/Broward County Convention Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>
<p>MSP Expo is the premier conference and networking summit for MSPs. This is where MSP business owners and technology specialists share strategies to grow their managed services businesses. Through interactive sessions, quality keynotes, exciting networking experiences and a recently expanded exhibit floor, Future of Work Expo connects businesses with the solutions, partners, and education they need to drive digital transformation.</p>
<p>“We’re glad to welcome DefensX as a Platinum sponsor of MSP Expo and Future of Work Expo in 2022,” said Rich Tehrani, TMC’s CEO. “DefensX makes sure the users are safe working anywhere on any network or device including desktops, laptops, whether iOS or Android.

They are a must-see next month.”</p>
<p>“SMBs have limited in-house cybersecurity capabilities due to budget pressures and hiring limitations, so they are looking for their managed service providers for seamless, cost-efficient cybersecurity tools,” said Dave Maik, Channel Director for DefensX North America. “Current professional services rendered by MSPs need to be bundled with simple, easily deployed cybersecurity tools that will yield higher returns. We are delighted to participate in both the MSP Expo and Future Of Work Expo, and to bring to light solutions that MSPs can begin to sell immediately, given the simplicity of our cloud-native, pure software offering.”</p>
