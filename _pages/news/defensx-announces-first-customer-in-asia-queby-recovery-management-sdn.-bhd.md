<p><b>Sold through trusted DefensX partner Vulsan-X, the sale officially marks DefenseX revenue growth in three large regions worldwide</b>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>New York, New York, USA; January 4, 2023 – DefensX™, a developer of zero-trust cybersecurity applications, today announced their newest client Queby Sdn. Bhd, a cybersecurity debt recovery management company. The sale was done through DefensX partner Vulsan-X.</p>
<p>Located in Malaysia, Queby’s mission is to leave no opportunities of recovery untapped, to relieve credit organizations of the complications of debt recovery, and to provide pre- and post- recovery assistance. Queby’s management team has extensive experience in the finance, manufacturing, trading debtor management, debt recovering and legal fields.</p>
<p>“DefensX’s zero-trust capabilities, which address the troubling rise in the frequency and intensity of phishing and other social engineering cyber-attacks, enhances Queby’s ability to protect their and their clients’ sensitive data,” can be traced to the rising numbers in phishing and other social engineering cyber-attacks,” said Dr. Prakash Christiansen, Chief Executive Officer at Vulsan-X. “The DefensX platform also protects Queby’s critical infrastructure, defending against attacks that could take down networks, applications, and integrations.”</p>

It was statistics like these that led Vulsan-X to partner with DefensX and bring a combination of expertise to the APAC region.</p>

<p>- Zero-Trust Web Protection</p>
<p>- Zero-Trust Credentials</p>
