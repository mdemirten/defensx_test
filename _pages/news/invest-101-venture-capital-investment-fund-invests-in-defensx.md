<p><strong>Invest 101 recognizes the importance of protecting individuals and organizations from growing web-borne cyber threats while contributing to economic growth </strong></p>
 
<p>Istanbul, Turkey; New York, New York, USA; May 8, 2023 –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.defensx.com/">DefensX</a>™, developer of a Zero-Trust Secure Web Browser extension and solutions today announced it has received an investment from the Development METU Technopark Venture Capital Investment Fund (Invest 101), established in cooperation with the Türkiye Development Fund (TDF) and METU Technopark&nbsp;</p>
<p>Invest101 supports new generation, early-stage technology startups, to scale up innovative solutions across artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), big data, cybersecurity, fintech, gaming technologies, software development technologies, internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), cloud technologies, advanced material, robotics, nanotechnology, biotechnology, renewable energy, and mobility.</p>
<p>“We are deeply honored to have been chosen by the Invest101 team, given their shared focus on creating strong regional and global companies engaged in strategic industries,” said Osman Erkan, Co-Founder and CEO of DefensX. “We look forward to becoming a strong contributor to their network of investors and entrepreneurs who are committed, as we are, to developing and expanding meaningful and sustainable solutions, especially in the cybersecurity arena as threats continue to accelerate.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are pleased to welcome Osman and the DefensX team to our Invest101 family,” said Elif Altug, Ph.D, CFA, CEO and Board Member of Türkiye Development Fund. “The company has already proven the enormous value of technology in our country, our region, and globally, and we look forward to their expansion in such a mission critical area. Without the ability to defend against growing threats, digital and structural transformation is limited. DefensX addresses risks in a modern way which is accessible, affordable, and sustainable.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last month, DefensX announced it had closed a financing round by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://revo.vc/">Revo</a>&nbsp;Capital, a venture capital fund investing in truly innovative, seed &amp; early-stage B2B or B2C technology&nbsp;ventures. The investment of Invest 101 was realized as an extention of the above-mentioned round.</p>
<p>As demand for DefensX solutions continues to grow in North America, Western and Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific and Europe Middle East and Africa, Invest 101 and Revo’s investments will accelerate further expansion and software-as-a-service development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DefensX’s Zero-Trust Secure Web Browser with capabilities including Zero-Trust Web Protection, Zero-Trust Credentials, Zero-Trust File Protection, Remote Browser Isolation, DNS++, and a cloud-first architecture that has been adopted by major distribution channels around the world, DefensX is now poised to scale as the challenges they have been solving for continue to mount.&nbsp;</p>
