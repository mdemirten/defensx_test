<p>ConnX and DefensX are teaming up to bring an extremely flexible cybersecurity solution to ConnX clients. Now these enterprises will have access to advanced threat protection on any device, on any network, from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>“As a leader in AI driven digital communications transformation, ConnX is an ideal technology and business development partner,” said Osman Erkan, founder and CEO of DefensX, a company with a mission to provide advanced threat protection on any device, any network and any location without the complexity and cost associated with legacy solutions by taking a cloud-native approach. “The innovative ConnX team developed ConnX MaestroAI, the industry’s first, AI powered, multi-service integrated communications platform.
