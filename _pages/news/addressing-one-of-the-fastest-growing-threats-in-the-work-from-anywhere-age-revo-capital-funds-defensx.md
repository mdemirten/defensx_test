<p>DefensX, a developer of a zero trust secure browser, announced it has closed a financing round by Revo Capital, a venture capital fund investing in early-stage B2B and B2C technology ventures.</p>
<p>“We are so pleased and so honored that the team at Revo is placing their trust in us,” said Halis Osman Erkan, founder and CEO of DefensX. “As a highly strategic and focused team with a deep understanding of IT infrastructure and the evolution of cloud, the contributions they will make go well beyond financial capital. Their track record of investing in truly disruptive start-ups is outstanding, and partnering with them not only strengthens our foundation but will benefit the many distributors and direct SMB and enterprise customers we have in place today and will allow us to attract more distributors worldwide.”</p>
<p>DefensX recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.defensx.com/news/defensx-announces-first-customer-in-asia-queby-recovery-management-sdn.-bhd/">announced</a>&nbsp;a distribution agreement with SpikeIT, a significant cybersecurity distributor in Israel, offering solutions for the Israeli market and DACH with a cyber security bundle. Earlier this year, DefensX also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.defensx.com/news/defensx-teams-up-with-exertis-mena-announcing-regional-distribution-agreement/">announced</a>&nbsp;a major distribution partnership with Exertis, MENA, the Dubai-based arm of global distributor DCC Technology (Exertis), and are offering DefensX cloud-based cybersecurity solutions to their regional base of consumer, business, and enterprise customers across the Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p>DefensX announced that lifecell, serving subscribers in Ukraine, based&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.msptoday.com/topics/msp-today/articles/455566-defensx-ukranes-lifecell-protect-subscribers-from-web-born.htm">its new cyber security offering on the DefensX</a>&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>DefensX’s Zero Trust Secure Web Browser includes a variety of capabilities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero Trust Web Protection,</li>
<li>Zero Trust Credentials,</li>
<li>Zero Trust File Protection,</li>
<li>Remote Browser Isolation,</li>
<li>DNS++, and</li>
<li>A cloud-first architecture that major distribution channels have adopted around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, DefensX is poised to scale as the challenges it has been solving for</p>
<p>continue to mount.</p>
<p>“As early supporters of Osman and his outstanding team, we look forward to working closely</p>
<p>with Revo Capital to scale up the business dramatically and bring the benefits of the DefensX</p>
<p>platform to hundreds more distributors, MSPs, and their end customers,” said David Walsh,</p>
<p>Chairman of DefensX. “In a cloud-first world, and in a completely transformed channel distribution ecosystem, DefensX has proven itself a true disrupter during the first phase of developing a cloud-native cyber security defense that will only grow in value as more applications and communications migrate to the cloud.”</p>
<p>With zero trust threat prevention technology, DefensX makes sure users are safe working</p>
<p>Anywhere, on any network, and on any device – including desktops, laptops, and iOS and Android tablets and phones.</p>
<p>“Cybercrime has become sneakier and more sophisticated than ever before, affecting</p>
<p>businesses of all sizes,” said Cenk Bayrakdar, Founding Partner &amp; Managing Director of Revo Capital. “Especially with remote working, it has become crucial that every employee remains hyper-vigilant about cybersecurity. With a distributed workforce, organizations must ensure the broadened organizational surface is aware. SMBs need a solution that is scalable,</p>
<p>affordable, and easily deployable. DefensX is this first line of defense, helping organizations stay ahead of threats. We are excited to join the DefensX founders on their journey to transform the nature of cybersecurity by liberating users with its context-aware approach.”</p>
<p>DefensX has several other global and regional distribution agreements with distributors, including&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.pax8.com/en-us/vendors/defensx/">Pax8</a>, a US-based B2B platform used by over 27,000 Managed Service Providers serving hundreds of thousands of SMBs and SMEs.</p>
