<p>Today we announced an investment in our future from the prestigious Development METU Technopark Venture Capital Investment Fund (Invest101), established in cooperation with the Türkiye Development Fund (TDF).</p>
<p>This follows an investment by Revo Capital, announced last month, and the confidence both organizations have placed in our mission is both humbling and exciting. Revo Capital is the largest VC in the region.</p>
<p>Invest101 supports new generation, early-stage technology startups, to scale up innovative solutions across artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), big data, cybersecurity, fintech, gaming technologies, software development technologies, internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), cloud technologies, advanced material, robotics, nanotechnology, biotechnology, renewable energy, and mobility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are deeply honored to have been chosen by the Invest101 team, given their shared focus on creating strong regional and global companies engaged in strategic industries, and are fully committed to becoming a strong contributor to their network of investors and entrepreneurs. It is noble to be a part of this next-generation organization, as we also share a passion for expanding meaningful and sustainable solutions, especially in the cybersecurity arena as threats continue to accelerate.</p>
<p><b>The world needs modern and scalable solutions to prevent social engineering attacks, with a zero-trust approach.</b></p>
<p>Consider this fact:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/human-error-cybersecurity-stats/">94 percent</a>&nbsp;of organizations that have experienced insider data breaches in the last year, human error was the top cause of serious incidents, according to 84 percent of IT leaders surveyed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On average today, there’s a cyberattack every&nbsp;<a href="https://dataprot.net/statistics/cyber-security-statistics/">39 seconds</a>, yet, in the U.S alone, only 10 percent of cybercrime gets reported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The total cost of global cybercrime is expected to reach&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckbrooks/2023/03/05/cybersecurity-trends--statistics-for-2023-more-treachery-and-risk-ahead-as-attack-surface-and-hacker-capabilities-grow/?sh=7de6dadb19db">USD 8 trillion</a>&nbsp;by the end of 2023, with on average companies losing around USD 200 thousand a year on cybercrime, which can prove to be a fatal blow for some SMBs.</p>
<p>The work we are doing together is important and timely: new threats call for new defenses, and with the support of our Co-Founder David Walsh, new capital from Invest101 and Revo, ongoing collaboration with our world-class partners, and the loyalty of the MSPs we have cultivated in our early days, we are on track to make not just a difference, but a great difference – together.</p>
