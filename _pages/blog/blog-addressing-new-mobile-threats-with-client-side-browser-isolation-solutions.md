<p>We are very proud to introduce our latest white paper which provides business context as well as a high-level view of our unique technology which is far easier to deploy, manage and scale on mobile devices.</p>
<p>With no need for special equipment, downloaded with a single click from application stores and a cloud-native approach, our solution is both sophisticated and simplified and comes at exactly the right moment as attacks on remote workers through their tablets and mobile devices continue to increase in frequency and severity.</p>
<p>Why wait to bring this cost-efficient and agile advanced threat solution forward? Because our cybersecurity experts and software developers start with the cloud and understand in detail what it takes to protect assets and infrastructure in an increasingly “multi-cloud” world, our approach means protection can be implemented immediately to your mobile devices which is not currently possible to get from expensive and proprietary traditional vendor solutions.</p>
<p>Give DefensX a try; we’ve created this white paper as a comprehensive overview of the category, the context and the creative ways we’ve conquered phishing, virus, ransomware and other major risks even as they continue to multiply in 2021.</p>
<p>Given the dramatic rise in remote working, explosion of cyberattacks on enterprise networks, data and applications, and the overall expansion of multi-cloud computing, Internet browsing on mobile devices and tablets are drastically increasing the attack surface.</p>
<p>According to Gartner, 98% of external attacks over the last few years were carried out over the public Internet and, of those attacks, 80% were targeted directly at end users through their browsers, independent from the end user device they utilize.</p>
<p>In this business white paper, you will learn more about the increasingly sophisticated attacks using the mobile browser to initiate a variety of attacks, and how cloud-native advanced web and threat protection eliminates risk as users see a rendering of a web page, but not the page itself, protecting against invisible downloading of malware/ransomware and viruses onto their device, and into enterprise networks. This approach protects against zero-day threats and enhances an overall cybersecurity posture.</p>
<p>DefensX is transforming the nature of cyber security by liberating users with a content to application approach. With its unique advanced web and threat protection technologies, DefensX seamlessly and effectively prevent cyber threats of today and tomorrow, providing a better user experience anywhere, on any network and on any device, at a fraction of the cost.</p>
