<p>On July 27<sup>th</sup>, 2021 we announced a global partnership with Pax8, a company that simplifies the way organizations buy, sell, and manage cloud solutions, empowering them to achieve more with cloud technology, to provide managed service providers (MSPs) endpoint security solutions for all devices.</p>
<p>Here's the backstory:&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the Covid-19 pandemic began, IT and network professionals at nearly every enterprise were forced into action as remote work became the norm following the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. Organizations across all industries were forced to go digital, which unfortunately led to a boom-time for potential cyber criminals.</p>
<p><b>Reports of&nbsp;</b><a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/20370/cyber-security-post-pandemic"><b>cybercrime</b></a>&nbsp;<b>shot up by almost&nbsp;</b><a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/18/fbi-cybercrime-losses-topped-us42billion-2020/#:~:text=Compared%20to%202019%2C%20the%20number,rose%20by%20a%20whopping%2069%25."><b>70</b></a>&nbsp;<b>percent in the US compared to 2019, as the lockdown created an ideal environment for cyber criminals.</b></p>
<p>The RSA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/20370/cyber-security-post-pandemic">Quarterly Fraud Report</a>&nbsp;found that during the Covid-19 pandemic, phishing and ransomware remained the most common approach, accounting for 33 percent of all cyberattacks. On top of this, with so many new devices in use due to remote work, account takeover attempts soared, and logins to a new account from a new device accounted for 31 percent of fraud activity. The multi factor authorization, which is claimed to be extremely safe and secure, was also easily breached.</p>
<p>One cybersecurity strategy many organizations are now turning to is a zero-trust architecture approach. Zero-trust is a security framework requiring all users, whether in or outside the organization’s network, to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated for security configuration and posture before being granted or keeping access to applications and data.</p>
<p>Zero-trust assumes that there is no traditional network edge; networks can be local, in the cloud, or a combination or hybrid with resources anywhere as well as workers in any location. This is a significant departure from traditional network security which followed the “trust but verify” method, but the old model became obsolete with the cloud migration of business transformation initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits related with zero-trust architecture are bountiful, such as reduced threat surface, maximized use and authority of authentication, limited possibility for data exfiltration, protection against both internal and external threats, as well as simply improving overall security posture both on-premises and in the cloud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of this, when endpoint security technology is incorporated with the core principles of the zero-trust architecture, data and networks can even be safely managed with employees spread out working remotely. Endpoint protection is the ability to protect the assets that are the last touch point of the network it is connected to.</p>
<p>With the growing number of endpoint devices inside of a business, it’s even more important to make sure endpoints are managed to help reduce the attack surface. Only once a device is managed, then we can begin to think about how to secure the device from today’s evolving threat landscape.</p>
<p>We are excited to work with Pax8 and offer our innovative solutions to their expansive partner ecosystem. The number and impact of cyber breaches targeting businesses of all sizes are growing exponentially.&nbsp; Organizations need to re-think the trust relationship built over the years with the Internet, end-users, devices, and locations. Our advanced zero-trust end-point web threat protection technology can easily secure and manage Pax8 partners and their end-users across all devices, ensuring their clients work safely from anywhere, on any device, over any network.</p>
<p>DefensX offers MSPs the following benefits:&nbsp;</p>
<p>● Zero-trust credential exposure &amp; phishing protection</p>
<p>● MFA breach protection</p>
<p>● Zero-trust remote browser and file isolation</p>
<p>● URL/URI protection, a technology replacing legacy DNS based protection</p>
<p>A cyber-attack on any customer can be catastrophic, but by leveraging our solutions with zero-trust architecture and endpoint security, businesses can stay vigilant and prepared for whatever evil lurks in the digital shadows.</p>
