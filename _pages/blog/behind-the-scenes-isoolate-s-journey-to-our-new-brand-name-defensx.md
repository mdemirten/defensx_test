<p>For the last two years, our mighty start-up has been developing what we consider to be the best remote browser isolation solution designed to protect businesses of all sizes from attacks that start at the edge of their networks: their employee’s desktop and mobile devices.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the global pandemic arrived in full force on the heels of our initial brand launch and fueled our passion for protecting organizations and every member of their team from the rising number of threats coming through the browser, whether reverse proxy attacks, social engineering, html smuggling and other dark side modern tactics.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on our culture and our constant commitment to our channels and their customers, and when we, like so many others, witnessed the dramatic growth in the volume, velocity, and impact of cybercrime in the context of rapid shifts to work-from-home models given laws designed to stem then stop the novel Corona virus, our sense of mission intensified.</p>
<p>We spent quality time with our channel partners and their customers, and we learned a great deal about what their biggest challenges were, and we set out to address those challenges in our unique way – keep things simple for end-users, simple for businesses, and simple and profitable for channels.</p>
<p>Today our offering includes, beyond browser isolation, Zero Trust Web Protection, Zero Trust Credentials Protection, Zero Trust File Protection and DNS Layer Protection, an easy to provision, implement and manage bundle of all five that is less complex and expensive than legacy approaches.</p>
<p>We learned from listening closely that given the growth of XaaS (everything as a service) that our cloud-native architecture was a huge plus and differentiated us from competitors whose heavy and expensive products were anything but end-user and customer friendly.</p>
<p>We are very proud today to fly a new flag, DefensX, as a symbol of our passion for the mission which our Founder and CEO Osman Erkan described in today’s press release announcing our re-emergence.</p>
<p>“Our mission and our message are simple,” said Osman Erkan, Founder and CEO of what is now DefensX. “We are highly focused on making it easy for businesses to allow their workers more freedom and flexibility while improving productivity by eliminating risks associated with all types of attacks – over any network, over any browser, on any device. We have brought together enterprise grade, novel threat defense tools and have made them easily available for anyone’s consumption. This is revolutionary, because adversaries use the most sophisticated tools which are built to attack governments, large enterprises to attack to SMB’s. SMB’s need enterprise layer of defense, with an affordable offering. Our software which can be downloaded to the device in minutes prevents users from accidentally clicking on dangerous links, or visiting dangerous websites, and with our expanded offering blocking the most sophisticated and subtle HTML hijacking campaigns. It includes self-enforced training while browsing the web for the end users. End users will be trained for cyber vigilance without noticing it.”</p>
<p>Why do we care so much – why do our channels and their customers care so much?</p>
<p>According to reports by Verizon (2021 Data Breach Investigation Report, Gartner, and SANS):</p>
<ul class="simple-list long-list">
<li class="list-item">85% of breaches involve a human element</li>
<li class="list-item">80% of breaches involve web browsers on mobile or desktop</li>
<li class="list-item">68% of attacks target endpoints</li>
<li class="list-item">61% of breaches involve stolen credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>With 30% of the workforce expected to continue working from home after the pandemic, DefensX democratizes cybersecurity, requiring only a browser extension or a mobile application so that MSPs can provide their clients high-quality security measures without reboots or patch management.</p>
<p>DefensX prevents sophisticated threats from reaching end-users by improving visibility across all devices, and its transformational technology immediately boosts security posture by offering MSPs the following benefits:</p>
<ul class="simple-list long-list">
<li class="list-item">Zero-trust credential exposure &amp; phishing protection</li>
<li class="list-item">MFA breach protection</li>
<li class="list-item">Zero-trust remote browser and file isolation</li>
<li class="list-item">URL/URI protection, a technology replacing legacy DNS based protection</li>
</ul>
<p>Please welcome us in celebrating this next, big step in our company’s future and always feel free to reach out and contact us so we can learn what challenges you’re up against, and so we can show you just how different – and how much better – and how much more secure – your world can be.</p>
