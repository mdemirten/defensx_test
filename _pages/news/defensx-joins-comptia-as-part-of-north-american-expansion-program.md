<p style="text-align: left;"><b>Company will demonstrate the DefensX cloud-based Security-as-a-Service platform at ChannelCon in Chicago August 2-4</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">NEW YORK, NY (July 19, 2022) – DefensX, a transformational provider of a zero-trust web threat protection platform designed for managed service providers (MSPs) and enabling protection of all devices, today announced it has joined the Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA), a leading voice and advocate for the $5 trillion global information technology ecosystem and the estimated 75 million industry and tech professionals who design, implement, manage, and safeguard the technology that powers the world’s economy.</p>
<p>DefensX will be demonstrating their full range of security solutions, sold through MSP and MSSP channels to their customers, who benefit from more freedom and flexibility while improving productivity by eliminating risks associated with all types of attacks – over any network, over any browser, on any device.</p>
<p>DefensX software can be downloaded to the device in minutes prevents users from accidentally clicking on dangerous links, or visiting dangerous websites, and with our expanded offering blocking the most sophisticated and subtle HTML hijacking campaigns.</p>
<p>The company’s offering includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote Browser Isolation (RBI) to include:</li>
<li>Zero Trust Web Protection</li>
<li>Zero Trust Credentials Protection</li>
<li>Zero Trust File Protection</li>
<li>DNS Layer Protection&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>“DefensX has been working over the last year with some of the most successful channel partners in the world, making our offerings available on advanced cloud marketplaces like Pax8, and working with MSPs like ConnX,” said Dave Maik, Channel Director for DefensX in North America. “We continue to invest in our extremely popular &nbsp;cloud first end point security innovations that are simple for end users, yet sophisticated and automated enough to defend against increasingly aggressive attacks, and deepen relationships between SMEs and their managed service providers. We are thrilled to be part of CompTIA and to be part of ChannelCon next month in Chicago.”</p>
<p>The Small Medium Business (SMB) market has been largely underserved when it comes to cyber protection, and with the rapid and growing shift to “work from anywhere” scenarios following the global pandemic have been the target of well-funded cyber criminals out to take advantage of a new perimeter and new user behaviors outside the traditional work environment.</p>
<p>Unique to the market, DefensX brings an easy to provision and use bundle designed specifically to protect remote workers, making sure those users are safe working from anywhere on any network and any device including desktops, laptops, and IoS and Android smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>According to reports by Verizon (2021 Data Breach Investigation Report, Gartner, and SANS):</p>
<ul>
<li>85% of breaches involve a human element</li>
<li>80% of breaches involve web browsers on mobile or desktop</li>
<li>68% of attacks target endpoints</li>
<li>61% of breaches involve stolen credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>With 30% of the workforce expected to continue working from home after the pandemic, DefensX democratizes cybersecurity, requiring only a browser extension or a mobile application so that MSPs can provide their clients high-quality security measures without reboots, patch management, or agent installations.</p>
<p>DefensX also prevents sophisticated threats from reaching end-users by improving visibility across all devices, and its transformational technology immediately boosts security posture by offering MSPs the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero-trust credential exposure &amp; phishing protection</li>
<li>MFA breach protection</li>
<li>Zero-trust remote browser and file isolation</li>
<li>URL/URI protection, a technology replacing legacy DNS based protection</li>
</ul>
