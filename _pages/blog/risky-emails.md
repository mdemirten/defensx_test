<p>E-mail originated complex attacks, have the most significant impact on enterprise security. Particularly spear-phishing, tailormade attacks designed social-engineering - can trick high-level users with spoofed e-mail content, and leads to irreversible damage. Such deceptive e-mails could flawlessly imitate the design of trustworthy organizations such as banks, tech corporations, governmental bodies, or trusted 3rd party partners. Attackers could deceive even technical employees with spoofed content delivered by e-mail.</p>
<p>Malicious e-mails are using two main methods to trick users:</p>
<ul class="simple-list long-list">
<li class="list-item">
<p>Convincing users to enter their credentials into input fields inside the e-mail or a spoofed page directed by the e-mail</p>
</li>
<li class="list-item">
<p>Manipulating users to download malicious software disguised as mail attachments, such as office documents, PDF documents, or images.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DefensX Secure Browsers Platform offers enterprise users immunity from e-mail based threats by seamlessly isolating attacks in remote, isolated browsers.</p>
<p>The primary measure DefensX takes is to detect suspicious links inside an e-mail, whether on a native e-mail client or inside the DefensX remote browser and disabling user entry to the input fields. By rendering pages in this read-only mode, DefensX prevents users from giving any sensitive data to the malicious actors, accidentally or by intent.</p>
<p>Moreover, DefensX never lets risky content to be directly downloaded to the user computer. Suspicious content is always opened in the remote browser and contained. Users can download it only after the DefensX sanitization tools disarm and reconstruct the content. When the user ends her browsing session, the malicious content disappears inside the disposable browser.</p>
