<p>In the past year, there was a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.phishingbox.com/resources/phishing-facts#:~:text=74%25,second%20in%20the%20last%20year.">74 percent</a>&nbsp;increase in phishing attacks sent every second, while in general&nbsp;<a href="https://firewalltimes.com/social-engineering-statistics/#:~:text=98%25%20of%20Cyber%20Attacks%20Involve,social%20engineering%20on%20some%20level.">98 percent</a>&nbsp;of cyber threats involve some form of social engineering.</p>
<p>Also in the past year, DefensX has grown exponentially, and after announcing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.defensx.com/defensx-announces-distributor-deal-with-spikeit-to-offer-cyber-security-bundle-in-europe-and-middle-east/">a new partnership in Israel</a>&nbsp;with SpikeIT in late December 2022, we are proud to announce that we are now active in three geographical regions: North America, Europe and the Middle East as we kick of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The cybersecurity market value in the Asia/Pacific region alone is expected to reach USD 150 billion by 2026 according to&nbsp;</b><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/09/15/2516536/0/en/Asia-Pacific-Cybersecurity-Market-revenue-to-reach-150-bn-by-2026-says-Graphical-Research.html"><b>Graphical Research</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<p>And, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/en-gb/resources/reports/dbir/" target="_blank">recent research from Verizon</a>, web application attacks are involved in 26% of all breaches, making the second most common attack pattern. However, applications aren’t the web’s only vulnerability.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Today’s</b><b>announcement celebrates our collaboration with Vulsan-X and their client, Queby.</b></p>
<p>Vulsan-X is a cyber defense organization providing threat intelligence and cyber risk mitigation by providing consulting and enabling technology.</p>
<p>Queby’s primary mission is to speed up the debt collection, with a proven ability to ensure effective and efficient recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Located in Malaysia, Queby leaves no opportunities of recovery untapped, to relieve credit organizations of the complications of debt recovery, and to provide pre- and post- recovery assistance. Queby’s management team has extensive experience in the finance, manufacturing, trading debtor management, debt recovering and legal fields.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“DefensX’s zero-trust capabilities, which address the troubling rise in the frequency and intensity of phishing and other social engineering cyber-attacks, enhances Queby’s ability to protect their and their clients’ sensitive data,” can be traced to the rising numbers in phishing and other social engineering cyber-attacks,” said Dr. Prakash Christiansen, Chief Executive Officer at Vulsan-X. “The DefensX platform also protects Queby’s critical infrastructure, defending against attacks that could take down networks, applications, and integrations.”</p>
