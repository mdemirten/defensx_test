<p>As attacks on endpoints continue to rise, fueled by more remote workers using the browser and cloud applications outside the traditional, physical perimeter, security teams are looking to Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) offerings to add an important layer of security – especially as more computing and communications is moving to the edge.</p>
<p>While EDR is not new, advanced EDR capabilities are being adopted by every size of company – from SMBs to enterprises – to automate threat hunting, detect evasive threats that legacy anti-virus software misses, accelerate compliance efforts, monitor user behavior, and centralize endpoint and network security monitoring across cloud and on-prem environments.</p>
<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/solutions/lp/sans-endpoint-survey.html" target="_blank">SANS Endpoint Protection and Response Survey</a>, 44% of IT departments manage somewhere between 5,000 and 500,000 endpoints. Large, global enterprises are adopting EDR software with AI and machine learning capabilities, connecting those capabilities with threat intelligence databases to block new threats and reduce breaches.</p>
<p><b>Especially given the explosion of remote and hybrid working,</b>employees use their phones and laptops, to check email, open apps, and browse the web within the same environment where they’re accessing company documents and applications.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ponemon.org/news-updates/news-press-releases/news/2018-state-of-smb-cybersecurity-report.html" target="_blank">Ponemon</a>, more than 50% of breaches in small and medium businesses are the result of human error.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/social-engineering/" target="_blank">Social engineering</a>&nbsp;is being increasingly used to access to a device or network through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/phishing-meaning/" target="_blank">phishing</a>&nbsp;or similar tactics.</p>
<p>It takes only one click on a malicious email or website to comprise the entire organization’s security.</p>
<p>Zero-trust threat prevention technology protects users from advanced cybersecurity attacks by isolating threats from reaching endpoint devices. Unfortunately for businesses, many employees can miss the signs that an email or website is malicious and unwittingly leave the door open for attackers to gain entry.</p>
<p>Without the right endpoint protection in place, breaches can cause major risk and lasting damage to businesses of any size. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hiscox.com/documents/2019-Hiscox-Cyber-Readiness-Report.pdf" target="_blank">2019 Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report</a>&nbsp;shows that a single breach could cost a company an average of $200,000.</p>
<p>For a small to medium business, that level of expense can be devastating.</p>
<p>Some EDR tools are combined with other types of software and sold as endpoint protection platforms (EPP) that contain additional features, like a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/vpn/" target="_blank">VPN</a>, managed services, and firewalls.</p>
<p><b>But the real issue is that while EDR protects the operating system, it is critical to provide similar functionality in web browsers.</b></p>
<p>EDR tools try to understand a malware’s existence based on its footprint. EDR’s challenge is to be able to differentiate legitimate behavior of the operating system and the end user with malware behavior.</p>
<p>For example, a user starting an application and malware starting the application is approximately the same.</p>
<p>EDR’s try to learn malware behavior and if detected then they respond. This approach is providing best results on the industry so far. That said, cyber criminals are very sophisticated, and in the case of EDR , have been know to install EDR tools which are cloud connected with access to the full-defensive logic.</p>
<p>Attackers test their malware against these tools and make sure they are undetectable.</p>
<p>They train the wild wolf to fly under the radar because they have the radar.</p>
<p><b>This is the gap for EDRs.</b></p>
<p>Therefore, even though EDR’s are in use, end points still need to layer front line defense and fortify protection.</p>
