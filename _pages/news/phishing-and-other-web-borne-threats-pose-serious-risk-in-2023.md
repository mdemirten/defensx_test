<p>There's no denying that the Internet has become the platform for doing business all around the world.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.allaccess.com/merge/archive/32972/infographic-what-happens-in-an-internet-minute" target="_blank">Every minute</a>, we, as a population, send 197.6 million emails, spend $1.6 million online and download almost 415,000 apps.</p>
<p>While our ever-increasing use of and reliance on the Internet provides businesses of all sizes endless communication, learning, and technological opportunities, it also makes organizations vulnerable to an array of traditional and emerging web-based threats.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/en-gb/resources/reports/dbir/" target="_blank">recent research from Verizon</a>, web application attacks are involved in 26% of all breaches, making it the second most common attack pattern. However, applications aren't the web's only vulnerability.</p>
<p>While the Internet has enabled many organizations to ensure their productivity throughout the shifts to remote and—more recently, hybrid—work following the impact of COVID-19, reliance on the internet makes it a lucrative target for attackers, many of whom focused their efforts on exploiting web vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>This week, DefensX, a developer of zero-trust cybersecurity applications, announced its newest client Queby Sdn. Bhd, a cybersecurity debt recovery management company. The sale was made through DefensX partner Vulsan-X.</p>
<p>Located in Malaysia, Queby's mission is to leave no opportunities for recovery untapped, to relieve credit organizations of the complications of debt recovery, and to provide pre- and post- recovery assistance. Queby's management team has extensive experience in the finance, manufacturing, trading debtor management, debt recovery, and legal fields.</p>
<p>"DefensX's zero-trust capabilities, which address the troubling rise in the frequency and intensity of phishing and other social engineering cyber-attacks, enhances Queby's ability to protect their and their client's sensitive data, can be traced to the rising numbers in phishing and other social engineering cyber attacks," said Dr. Prakash Christiansen, Vulsan-X CEO. "The DefensX platform also protects Queby's critical infrastructure, defending against attacks that could take down networks, applications, and integrations."</p>
<p>In the past year, there was a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.phishingbox.com/resources/phishing-facts#:~:text=74%25,second%20in%20the%20last%20year." target="_blank">74 percent</a>&nbsp;increase in phishing attacks every second, while in general,&nbsp;<a href="https://firewalltimes.com/social-engineering-statistics/#:~:text=98%25%20of%20Cyber%20Attacks%20Involve,social%20engineering%20on%20some%20level." target="_blank">98 percent</a>&nbsp;of cyber threats involve some form of social engineering. It was statistics like these that led Vulsan-X to partner with DefensX and bring a combination of expertise to the APAC region.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity market value in the Asian/Pacific region alone is expected to reach $150 billion by 2026, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/09/15/2516536/0/en/Asia-Pacific-Cybersecurity-Market-revenue-to-reach-150-bn-by-2026-says-Graphical-Research.html" target="_blank">Graphical Research</a>.</p>
<p>DefensX cyber protection capabilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS Security</li>
<li>Zero-Trust Web Protection</li>
<li>Zero-Trust Credentials</li>
<li>Zero-Trust File Protection</li>
<li>Remote Browser Isolation</li>
<li>Cyber Security Training</li>
</ul>
<p>"We are honored to work with Queby and Vulsan-X to address rapidly growing and increasingly dangerous web-borne threats," said Osman Erkan, DefensX founder and CEO. "We look forward to serving the APAC region while we also expand our customer based in North America, Europe, and the UK in the coming new year."</p>
<p>DefensX protects users from sophisticated cybersecurity attacks by isolating threats before reaching endpoint devices, such as desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, with zero-trust transformational application-to-content protection technology that works on any device, anywhere, and over any network.</p>
<p>Vulsan-X is a cyber defense organization providing threat intelligence and cyber risk mitigation by providing consulting and enabling technology. Queby's primary mission is to speed up debt collection, with a proven ability to ensure effective and efficient recovery.</p>
