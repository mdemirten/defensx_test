<p>There has been an increase in cyber attacks alongside other forms of aggression within Ukraine. Recent developments suggest that mobile networks are being used to track individuals' locations in real time, with the signals from their phones being analyzed to launch strikes at specific locations.</p>
<p>Most cyber attacks exploit vulnerabilities in outdated browsers, plug-ins, and other components, injecting malicious code into website components. Surprisingly,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.trellix.com/en-us/index.html" target="_blank">95% of undetectable malware</a>&nbsp;is spread through web browsing, with organizations losing an average of $<a href="https://www.morphisec.com/hubfs/1111/briefs/BrowserAttacksBrief-190327.pdf" target="_blank">3.2 million</a>&nbsp;to browse-borne malware.</p>
<p>Not only are people at risk due to these attacks but also managed service providers (MSPs) based in the affected region. Around&nbsp;<a href="https://ain.capital/2020/02/19/20-companies-from-ukraine-among-global-outsourcing-100/" target="_blank">13 of the top 100 outsourcing service providers</a>&nbsp;globally are located in the area, with eight additional companies having offices there. These MSPs struggle to stay online, facing challenges beyond their physical infrastructure and personnel.</p>
<p>Ukrainian MSPs have made efforts to counter the ongoing cyber attacks, with innovative cybersecurity solutions becoming increasingly available to aid response efforts and alleviate the burden caused by these attacks. Still, only&nbsp;<a href="https://www.channele2e.com/news/ukraine-russia-war-may-impact-outsourced-it-services-market/" target="_blank">45% of the IT organizations</a>&nbsp;in the region had emergency response plans in place, with another 47% developing such strategies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.defensx.com/">DefensX</a>, a developer of zero trust cybersecurity applications, recently announced it has partnered with lifecell, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lifecell.ua/en/" target="_blank">Ukrainian telecommunications operator</a>&nbsp;providing mobile communication and data transfer services based on high-speed Internet to provide next-level protection against growing, web-borne cyber attacks.</p>
<p>"We are proud to bring an array of solutions to lifecell as digital attacks continue to rise in war torn Ukraine," said Halis Osman Erkan, founder and CEO of DefensX, which is a platform designed for service providers, enabling effective, easy-to-install, and manage, and cost-effective browser-based, pure cloud cyber protection at a fraction of the price of legacy solutions. "Given our complimentary architectures and a shared vision for cloud and internet-based communications applications, DefensX and lifecell are a perfect fit, especially as cloud telco digital transformation accelerates."</p>
<p>Eighty percent of cyber attacks involve web browsers, and DefensX Secure Web Browser protects individuals and organizations from being infected by malware on malicious websites, phishing attacks designed to steal credentials, and increasingly sophisticated Adware â€“ a type of malware that displays unwanted advertisements on smartphones and computers. The activation happens unknowingly when users are trying to install legitimate applications that Adware is bundled with.</p>
<p>The DefensX Secure Web Browser made by lifecell is available to all its subscribers who seek privacy and protection of their personal data on the Internet. DefensX can be activated in minutes on one to five devices using a USSD code or SMS.</p>
<p>Subscribers of lifecell simply start using the DefensX browser, which identifies malicious websites and blocks accessing these sites to protect individuals and businesses from various types of web threats.</p>
<p>Specific features include:</p>
<p><strong>Zero Trust Web Protection</strong></p>
<p>There are many risky websites on the internet, and subscribers may find themselves visiting one of the malicious websites without knowing what is waiting for them there. DefensX identifies malicious websites and blocks accessing these sites to protect users from various types of web threats.</p>
<p><strong>Zero Trust Credentials Protection</strong></p>
<p>Phishing attacks pretending to be legitimate websites trick end-users into entering their usernames/passwords to steal valuable, personal, and sensitive data. DefensX uses Artificial Intelligence to identify phishing web pages and prevents users from entering their passwords, stopping cybercriminals in their tracks.</p>
<p><strong>Adware Protection</strong></p>
<p>DefensX detects potential ADware attack surfaces within web pages and removes those risk elements in the web pages. DefensX protects end-users and businesses from harmful Adware and does so without slowing down or otherwise preventing a smooth user experience.</p>
<p>"DefensX also brings lifecell an immediate solution addressing the alarming growth of zero-day attacks, so much so that we refer to our solution as zero-hour," Erkan said. "Our phishing protection/credential protection feature has AI capabilities that can detect computer-software vulnerabilities previously unknown to those needing real-time mediation, including providers of the target software. Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers, or a network, leading to potentially severely damaging devices, networks, and applications."</p>
