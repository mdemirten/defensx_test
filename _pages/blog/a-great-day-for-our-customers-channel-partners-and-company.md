<p>Today we announced an important milestone for DefensX: we have closed a financing round by Revo Capital, a venture capital fund investing in truly innovative, seed &amp; early-stage B2B or B2C technology&nbsp;ventures.</p>
<p>Revo is the largest VC in Turkey. At the end of 2013 they raised a first fund of $66M, and in September 2021, closed their first oversubscribed second fund of â‚¬90 million. They invest in truly innovative, early-stage B2B or B2C technology ventures in Turkey, Eastern Europe, and the Baltics and so far, have made 31 investments and 13 successful exits to date.</p>
