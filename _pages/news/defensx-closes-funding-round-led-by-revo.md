<p>New York, New York, USA; April 18, 2023 –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.defensx.com/" target="_self">DefensX</a>™, developer of a Zero-Trust Secure Web Browser today announced it has closed a financing round by&nbsp;<a href="https://revo.vc/" target="_blank">Revo</a>&nbsp;Capital, a venture capital fund investing in truly innovative, seed &amp; early-stage B2B or B2C technology&nbsp;ventures.</p>
<p>As demand for DefensX solutions continues to grow in North America, Western and Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific and Europe Middle East and Africa, Revo Capital closed on an investment that will accelerate further expansion and software-as-a-service development.</p>
<p>DefensX’s Zero-Trust Secure Web Browser with capabilities including Zero-Trust Web Protection, Zero-Trust Credentials, Zero-Trust File Protection, Remote Browser Isolation, DNS++, and a cloud-first architecture that has been adopted by major distribution channels around the world, DefensX is now poised to scale as the challenges they have been solving for continue to mount.</p>
<p>• 80% of the breaches involve web browsers on mobile/desktop</p>
<p>• 85% of the breaches involve a human element</p>
<p>• 68% of the attacks target endpoints</p>
<p>With zero-trust threat prevention technology, DefensX makes sure the users are safe working anywhere on any network or device, including desktops, laptops, and iOS &amp; Android.</p>
<p>“Cybercrime has become sneakier and more sophisticated than ever before, affecting businesses of all sizes,” said Cenk Bayrakdar, Founding Partner &amp; Managing Director, Revo Capital. “Especially with remote working, it has become crucial that every employee remains hyper-vigilant about cybersecurity.&nbsp; With a distributed workforce, organizations must ensure the broadened organizational surface is aware. SMBs need a solution that is scalable, affordable, and easily deployable. DefensX is this first line of defense, helping organizations stay ahead of threats. We are excited to join the DefensX founders on their journey to transform the nature of cybersecurity by liberating users with its context-aware approach.”</p>
<p>“We are so pleased and so honored that the team at Revo is placing their trust in us,” said Halis Osman Erkan, founder and CEO of DefensX. “As a highly strategic and focused team, with deep understanding of IT infrastructure and the evolution of cloud, the contributions they will make go well beyond financial capital. Their track record of investing in truly disruptive start-ups is outstanding, and partnering with them not only strengthens our foundation, but will benefit the many distributors and direct SMB and enterprise customers we have in place today and will allow us to attract more distributors worldwide.”</p>
<p>“As early supporters of Osman and his outstanding team, we look forward to working closely with Revo Capital to scale up the business dramatically and bring the benefits of the DefensX platform to hundreds more distributors, MSPs and their end customers,” said David Walsh, Chairman of the company, and innovator, entrepreneur, private investor, and former private equity investor for over ten years at JPMorganChase One Equity Partners. “In a cloud-first world, and in a completely transformed channel distribution ecosystem, DefensX has proven they are a true disrupter during the first phase of developing a cloud-native cyber security defense that will only grow in value as more applications and communications migrate to the cloud.”</p>
<p>DefensX has several other global and regional distribution agreements with distributors, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pax8.com/en-us/vendors/defensx/" target="_blank">Pax8</a>, a US-based B2B platform used by over 27,000 Managed Service Providers serving hundreds of thousands of SMBs and SMEs.</p>
