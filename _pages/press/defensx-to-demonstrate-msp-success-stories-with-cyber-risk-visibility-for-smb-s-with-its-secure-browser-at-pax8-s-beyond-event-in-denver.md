<p>Denver, CO; New York, New York, USA; May 30, 2023 –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.defensx.com/" target="_self">DefensX</a>™, developer of a Zero-Trust Secure Web Browser extension and cyber security solutions, today announced they are sponsoring the inaugural customer event hosted by Pax8, one of the world’s largest B2B cloud marketplace which simplifies the way organizations buy, sell, and manage cloud solutions, empowering their partners to achieve more with cloud technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This first-of-its-kind event is taking place from June 11-13, 2023, at the Gaylord Rockies Convention Center, in Denver, Colorado. DefensX’s booth will be in the exhibition area, on Monday, June 12, from 5:15 – 8:00 PM, and Tuesday, June 13, from 1:00 – 3:00 PM, Mountain Time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to highlighting cyber security risk scoring for SMB’s, secure Browser for social engineering protection and DNS++, the DefensX team will also share success stories from around the world provided by MSPs who have rolled out the company’s solution to customers in North America, Asia Pacific, Europe.</p>
<p>DefensX has been succeeding on the Pax8 marketplace as part of a consistent and targeted cybersecurity offering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pax8beyond.com/" target="_blank">Beyond event</a>&nbsp;will bring together over a thousand technology professionals for three days of immersive learning and innovation created by and for MSP business owners, service managers, engineers, sales and marketing professionals, and security experts.</p>
<p>“Pax8 has been an important contributor to the success of our business” said founder and CEO of DefensX, Osman Erkan. “We are honored to sponsor this event and share our progress including the addition of exciting new features across the solutions we deliver, from cyber security end user risk scoring, secure browser and DNS++, and much more. We look forward to being part of their exhibition, where we will also share testimonials from around the world, from MSPs who have implemented our solution quickly and effectively, and have protected their own valuable infrastructure and assets, while extending the best protection possible to thousands of their customers.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>DefensX's Zero Trust Secure Web Browser – with capabilities including Zero Trust Web Protection, Zero Trust Credentials, Zero Trust File Protection, Remote Browser Isolation, and DNS++– is built on a cloud-first, SMB-first architecture that has been adopted by major distribution channels selling through MSP’s around the world.</p>
<p>With two new recent investments, DefensX is poised to scale as the security challenges they have been addressing continue to mount.</p>
<p>In May, the company received funding from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.turkiyekalkinmafonu.com.tr/en/our-funds/development-odtu-teknokent-vcif" target="_blank">Development METU Technopark Venture Capital Investment Fund</a>&nbsp;(Invest101), established in cooperation with the Türkiye Development Fund (TDF&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.tmcnet.com/snapshots/snapshots.aspx?Company=TDF" target="_blank">News</a>-<a href="http://www.tmcnet.com/enews/subs.aspx?k1=%22TDF%22" target="_blank">Alert</a>)) and METU Technopark.</p>
<p>In April, DefensX announced it had closed a financing round by&nbsp;<a href="https://revo.vc/" target="_blank">Revo</a><u>&nbsp;Capital</u>, a venture capital fund investing in truly innovative, seed and early-stage B2B or B2C technology&nbsp;ventures. The investment of Invest 101 was realized as an extension of the above-mentioned round.</p>
<p>The announcements came at a time when many organizations across nearly all industries are looking to enhance their cyber security defense capabilities with additional Secure Browser layer, including as a means of shielding their social engineering attack surface.</p>
<p>On top of a larger surface area for attacks, cyber criminals are leveraging new methods for evading defensive protocols once they've gained access to the cloud. In 2022, most hackers tried to evade defenses by deactivating security products running inside virtual machines, while some attempted to masquerade by choosing proxy exits close to expected victim locations or naming newly created virtual machines according to victims' naming schemes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, whichever tactic a hacker uses to gain access to an enterprise's cloud, the consequences can be drastic and, in some cases fatal to businesses, depending on the size of the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
