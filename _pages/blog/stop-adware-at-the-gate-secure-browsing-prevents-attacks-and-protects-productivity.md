Browser-based and web-borne attacks are tricky for individual employees and organizations to defend against, as they exploit vulnerabilities, including outdated browsers, plug-ins, and other components.

These types of attacks can be devastating, costing organizations an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.morphisec.com/hubfs/1111/briefs/BrowserAttacksBrief-190327.pdf">average of $3.2M per breach</a>. What makes these attacks even more terrifying is how common they have become.

Adware is a type of malware that displays unwanted advertising on your phone or computer. It can be installed without your knowledge and is difficult to remove.

Adware is becoming more diverse and sophisticated, with some strains designed to collect personal information like your browsing history and sell it to third-party companies. Adware can also compromise users’ privacy and security by tracking their online activities and collecting personal information while also posing a serious risk to sensitive data and information, which can expose an organization to legal and regulatory liabilities.

In addition, adware can be a vector for other types of malwares including viruses, spyware, and ransomware, which can cause further harm to a computer system.

**Adware can be very difficult to remove so the best course is prevention, and with the right software, every individual in any organization can be armed to stop adware in its tracks.**

Adware is short for “advertisements software,” and is a form of malware injected into web browsers in pop-ups, banner ads, or other forms of intrusive advertising.

End users and system administrators at MSPs need to be aware of the symptoms and take steps to detect and remove adware infections to protect computer systems and networks.

One of the most common symptoms of adware infections is the **display of unwanted ads** and pop-ups on a computer or mobile device, which can nefariously track a user’s online activities and can interfere with productivity.

Another common symptom of adware is the **redirection of a user’s web browser** to specific websites without the user’s consent or knowledge. Adware can manipulate a user’s web browser settings and redirect the user to websites that display ads or collect user data. This is confusing for users and exposes them and their company to security risks.

Adware can also cause a computer or mobile device to **slow down or even freeze**, due to the consumption of system resources and bandwidth to display ads, impacting performance and reducing user productivity.

**Adware is a type of malware.**

Malware is a catch-all term for any software that is designed to cause harm to a computer or phone or its user and networks and cloud applications the user connects to. Adware is a specific type of malware that commonly redirects the user to malicious websites or tricks them into downloading other forms of malware onto the computer.

**An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.**

Adware alone <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dataprot.net/statistics/malware-statistics/">accounts for 48% of all malware</a>. When adware reaches smartphones, without proper protection, it can unlock access to a single end-user while potentially providing easy access to corporate information and systems.
