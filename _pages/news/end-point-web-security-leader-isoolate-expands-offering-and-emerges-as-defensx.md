<p><b><i>From cloud-native browser isolation to a rich range of end-point cybersecurity capabilities, company continues to bring Managed Service Providers simplified yet sophisticated zero-trust solutions for small to medium size businesses</i></b></p>
<p>NEW YORK, NY (March 1,2022) – Isoolate, a transformational provider of a zero-trust web threat protection platform designed for managed service providers (MSPs) and enabling protection of all devices, today announced it has changed its brand name to DefensX.</p>
<p>This new brand is aligned with the introduction of endpoint security solutions beyond Isoolate’s original browser isolation offering, with additional zero-trust capabilities that further protect organizations from sophisticated cyberattacks across any and every device. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The DefensX team worked over the last year with channel partners, and in consultation with the small and medium sized businesses the company ultimately serves, to develop cloud first end point security innovations that are simple for end users, yet sophisticated and automated enough to defend against increasingly aggressive attacks.</p>
<p>The Small Medium Business (SMB) market has been largely underserved when it comes to cyber protection, and with the rapid and growing shift to “work from anywhere” scenarios following the global pandemic have been the target of well-funded cyber criminals out to take advantage of a new perimeter and new user behaviors outside the traditional work environment.</p>
<p>“Our mission and our message are simple,” said Osman Erkan, Founder and CEO of what is now DefensX. “We are highly focused on making it easy for businesses to allow their workers more freedom and flexibility while improving productivity by eliminating risks associated with all types of attacks – over any network, over any browser, on any device. Let’s not forget, adversaries are using the most sophisticated tools that they utilize to attack governments and large enterprises who can spend huge for their defense lines. SMB’s need to access these technologies in an affordable pricing. Our software which can be downloaded to the device in minutes prevents users from accidentally clicking on dangerous links, or visiting dangerous websites, drive by ransomware downloads and with our expanded offering blocking the most sophisticated and subtle HTML5/JS attack campaigns. It includes self-enforced training while browsing the web. End users will be trained for cyber vigilance without noticing it.”</p>
<p>The company’s offering began with an advanced local and remote browser isolation service, which was so well received that it inspired MSPs and their end customers to ask for similar simple but powerful protections.</p>
<p>The company has expanded based on its success with Remote Browser Isolation (RBI) to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero Trust Web Protection</li>
<li>Zero Trust Credentials Protection</li>
<li>Zero Trust File Protection</li>
<li>DNS Layer Protection</li>
</ul>
<p>Unique to the market, DefensX brings an easy to provision and use bundle designed specifically to protect remote workers, making sure those users are safe working from anywhere on any network and any device including desktops, laptops, and IoS and Android smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>“We protect users from novel web borne threats on any device and over any network by applying zero-trust across the board,” Erkan explained. “DefensX breaks the cyberattack lifecycle at the weakest link, where attacks are delivered and where vulnerabilities are exploited – at the endpoint. Our Zero-trust solutions prevent credentials from being exposed, enable safe web browsing with intelligent warnings based on policy, deliver a “3rd eye” on end-user mistakes, make possible zero-trust control for downloads, and importantly provide instant, real time actionable intelligence. We are passionate about solving for these big challenges but in a way that is nearly invisible to the end-user and incredibly valuable to businesses including those who are required by law to comply with measures that protect their customers from the impact of breaches.”</p>
<p>According to reports by Verizon (2021 Data Breach Investigation Report, Gartner, and SANS):</p>
<ul>
<li>85% of breaches involve a human element</li>
<li>80% of breaches involve web browsers on mobile or desktop</li>
<li>68% of attacks target endpoints</li>
<li>61% of breaches involve stolen credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>With 30% of the workforce expected to continue working from home after the pandemic, DefensX democratizes cybersecurity, requiring only a browser extension or a mobile application so that MSPs can provide their clients high-quality security measures without reboots or patch management.</p>
<p>DefensX also prevents sophisticated threats from reaching end-users by improving visibility across all devices, and its transformational technology immediately boosts security posture by offering MSPs the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zero-trust credential exposure &amp; phishing protection</li>
<li>MFA breach protection</li>
<li>Zero-trust remote browser and file isolation</li>
<li>URL/URI protection, a technology replacing or improving legacy DNS based protection</li>
</ul>
